Hello, 
This is a basic Album store project created from Angular framework. So you may need to install node.js in your computer to run this project in your local.

Version used:
Angular CLI: 12.1.4
Node: 14.15.1

Run "npm install" to install the node modules 
after the node modules has been installed

Run "npm start" so that you can run your project in your local machine

After compilation open the browser and hit the URL "http://localhost:4200/dashboard".

About the components:

Here we have created seperate components for each album available in the store.

Each component consists of following 4 files:
•	.HTML
•	.CSS
•	.TYPESCRIPT
•	.SPEC.TYPESCRIPT

We have also used bootstrap – CSS to make the UI clean.
We  have  attached the YouTube links of the most popular songs inside each album.
